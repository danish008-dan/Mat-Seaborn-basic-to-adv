📊 Matplotlib vs Seaborn (Detailed Explanation)
🔹 1. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a low-level data visualization library in Python.
It is very powerful but requires more code and manual customization.

✅ Features:

Provides complete control over every aspect of the plot (axes, labels, ticks, colors, grid, etc.).

Can create almost any type of visualization (line, bar, scatter, histogram, pie, etc.).

Works with NumPy arrays and Pandas data.

Syntax is similar to MATLAB (that’s why it’s called Matplotlib).

⚡ Pros:

Very flexible (fine-tuned control).

Good for scientific and technical plots.

Integrates with many Python libraries.

❌ Cons:

Verbose → requires writing more code for styling.

Default styles look plain and less attractive.

🔹 Example:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y, color="red", linestyle="--", marker="o")
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

🔹 2. Seaborn

Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib.
It makes plots beautiful by default and is designed for statistical data visualization.

✅ Features:

Works directly with Pandas DataFrames.

Has many built-in datasets for practice (e.g., iris, tips).

Provides advanced plots like:

Heatmap

Pairplot

Violin plot

Swarm plot

Regression plots

⚡ Pros:

Easy to use with less code.

Beautiful default themes.

Perfect for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Supports categorical plots (grouping, aggregation).

❌ Cons:

Less flexible than Matplotlib (limited customizations).

Works best with statistical / structured data, not raw arrays.

🔹 Example:
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

sns.barplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips, palette="Set2")
plt.title("Average Total Bill per Day")
plt.show()

🔹 3. Key Differences
Feature	Matplotlib	Seaborn
Level	Low-level (manual)	High-level (built on Matplotlib)
Code Length	More code	Less code
Customization	Full control	Limited control
Default Style	Simple / plain	Attractive & modern
Best Use Case	Custom scientific plots	Quick EDA & statistical plots
Data Handling	Works with NumPy / Pandas	Works best with Pandas
🔹 4. When to Use What?

Use Matplotlib when:

You need full customization.

You are creating scientific or engineering plots.

You want low-level control (axes, ticks, colors, etc.).

Use Seaborn when:

You are doing data analysis / EDA.

You want beautiful plots quickly.

You are working with Pandas DataFrames.

✅ Summary:

Matplotlib = A toolbox (you can build anything, but takes time).

Seaborn = A decorator (makes everything look nice with minimal effort).

In practice: Most people use Seaborn for quick analysis, and Matplotlib for final fine-tuning.
